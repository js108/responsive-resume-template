Preview http://joeschoech.com/responsive-resume-template

##Instructions 

Enter your info into js/resume.js inside the quotes.

```
skillsHead: "Skills",
  skills: [
    {name: "PUT THE NAME OF YOUR SKILL HERE", competence: "AND YOUR COMPETENCE HERE"},
    {name: "Being nice", competence: "Good"},
    {name: "Comportment", competence: "Bad"},
  ],
```

Add or subtract lines from the sections as nessisary. 

If you're working on the css compile resume.scss to resume.css. Or just work straight off resume.css if you must. I didn't minify it. Though I almost did. You're going to want to advoid messing with most of it as it's the frameworks' code.

##Dependencies

Built with with <a href='http://handlebarsjs.com'>handlebars</a>, <a href='http://typeplate.com'>typeplate</a>, and <a # href='http://csswizardry.com/csswizardry-grids'>csswizardry grids</a>. Mostly because I wanted to try them.

##I hope you get the job

You are worthy.
